The purpose of the project is to serve better for patients who needs some dental services. With the help of this site people could get some information about the clinic, be aware of expert dentists, and make sure that the service of the clinic is exellent by reading feedback of people who has been served before and easily book an appointment online which will save their precious time. 

This site has 6 pages:
•	Home
•	About
•	Services
•	Expert Doctors
•	Reviews and
•	Booking page

There are footer in every single page and the information in the contact info and follow us is fake.

In creating this site I, definitely used some external sources like google fonts (to make my text look better), also I take several icons from the site “Font Awesome”, downloaded some pictures from google, and used Freepik to download free illustrations. 

Moreover, I created a validation form in javascript to protect this site and after inputing the right number in the box of validation form there will appear a button that will book you an appointment. Javascript is also used for toggling navigation button in mobile version.
